This project follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

It is an interpreter for [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple
scripting language.

# Using the Interpreter

1. Ensure you have `python (3.12)` installed locally
2. Input your script into `input.txt`
3. Run `./program.sh` to run the program implemented in `app/main.py`.
